# Sediment Stress

This study evaluated the transcriptomic responses of corals with different morphological characteristics in response to different types of sediment stress. Five coral species (_Acropora cervicornis_, _Montestraea cavernosa_, _Orbicella faveolata_, _Pocillopora acuta_, and _Porites lobata_) were assessed at two locations (Florida and Hawaiâ€™i). Floridian corals (_A. cervicornis_, _M. cavernosa_ and _O. faveolata_) were exposed to sterilized white carbonate sediment for 30 days, whereas Hawaiian corals (_P. acuta_ and _P. lobata_) were exposed to unsterilized terrigenous red soil for up to 7 days.
